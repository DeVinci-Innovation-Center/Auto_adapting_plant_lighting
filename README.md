# Auto_adapting_plant_lighting

## Overview

The goal of this project is to make a plant lighting that automatically adapts to the meteorological conditions. 
It is purposed to compensate the lack of natural lighting with artificial light.
The user can also implement working hours for the lighting, meaning the lights will just be on when the current time is comprised in the activation time zone.

## Instructions

To be able to connect to WiFi and send valid API requests, the user must change the fields "YOUR_XXXX_HERE" above the setup() function with their information.
If specified by a comment, some values also need to be changed to ensure that the meteorological and time data is relevant to their geographic zone.
